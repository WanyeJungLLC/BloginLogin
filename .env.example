# BloginLogin - Environment Variables
# Copy this file to .env and update the values as needed

# ===========================================
# ADMIN CREDENTIALS (Required for first run)
# ===========================================
# These credentials are used to create the initial admin account.
# 
# PRODUCTION WARNING:
# - DO NOT use these default values in production!
# - In production, admin will NOT be created unless ADMIN_USERNAME,
#   ADMIN_PASSWORD, and ADMIN_EMAIL are explicitly set.
# - Leave these blank in .env and set them via your platform's 
#   secret manager (Replit Secrets, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.)
# 
# DEVELOPMENT:
# - Default admin is auto-created only if no admin exists.
# - If not set, defaults to "John Stamos" / "1sR3aLLyAcL0n3!" / "change-me@example.com"
#   (these are FAKE placeholders for bootstrapping only!)
# 
# BEST PRACTICE:
# - Set strong credentials here BEFORE first run
# - After first login, immediately change them via Admin Settings UI
# 
# Password requirements:
# - Minimum 8 characters (longer is better)
# - Consider using a passphrase for better security
# - Mix of letters, numbers, and symbols recommended
#
ADMIN_USERNAME=John Stamos
ADMIN_PASSWORD=1sR3aLLyAcL0n3!
ADMIN_EMAIL=change-me@example.com

# ===========================================
# DATABASE
# ===========================================
# PRODUCTION WARNING:
# - DO NOT use this example DATABASE_URL in production!
# - Create a unique database with strong credentials
# - Use a least-privilege Postgres user (not superuser)
# 
# Security best practices:
# 1. Create a dedicated database and user:
#    CREATE USER bloginlogin_app WITH PASSWORD 'strong-random-password';
#    CREATE DATABASE bloginlogin_prod;
#    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE bloginlogin_prod TO bloginlogin_app;
# 
# 2. For remote databases, enable SSL:
#    Add ?sslmode=require to the connection string
#    Example: postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/db?sslmode=require
# 
# 3. Keep database internal (not publicly exposed):
#    - Use private networking in Docker/VPC
#    - Configure firewall rules to restrict access
# 
# 4. Rotate credentials regularly and store in secrets manager
# 
# On Replit: DATABASE_URL is automatically set via Replit Postgres.
# For local development: Use the docker-compose.yml provided or your own PostgreSQL.
#
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://bloginlogin:bloginlogin@localhost:5432/bloginlogin

# ===========================================
# STORAGE PROVIDER
# ===========================================
# Controls where uploaded files are stored.
# 
# On Replit: 
# - Uses Replit Object Storage automatically (no config needed)
# - Leave STORAGE_PROVIDER unset or commented out
# - Public assets: store in public/ path
# - Protected assets: use ACLs and configure storage.rules
# 
# For local development/self-hosted:
# - Set to "local" to store files in ./uploads folder
# - WARNING: Local uploads are served publicly from /uploads
# - Only use for public assets (blog images, portfolio screenshots)
# - Do NOT store sensitive documents in local uploads
#
STORAGE_PROVIDER=local

# ===========================================
# SESSION SECRET (Optional)
# ===========================================
# Used to sign session cookies. Auto-generated if not set.
# For production, set a strong random string.
#
# SESSION_SECRET=your-secure-random-string-here

# ===========================================
# REPLIT OBJECT STORAGE (Replit only - auto-configured)
# ===========================================
# These are set automatically when using Replit Object Storage.
# Leave commented for local development.
#
# DEFAULT_OBJECT_STORAGE_BUCKET_ID=your-bucket-id
# PUBLIC_OBJECT_SEARCH_PATHS=public
# PRIVATE_OBJECT_DIR=.private
